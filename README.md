# Showcase
This is a draft of a showcase to replace my old outdated portfolio repo. <br>
Rather than containing everything in the repo itself, it will just point to different repos. <br>
I haven't transferred everything yet, and I will be adding more things over time.

# Apple Developer Academy 

### Year 1: iOS

At the Apple Developer Academy I worked on many iOS apps in the first year. Most of these I co-developed with other students on teams of between 4 to 6 people. 
As the ownership of these apps is split between many people, these usually don't make it to the App Store. 

I worked on the following iOS apps:

  - Lina: An app for teachers that provides fun, educational activities that they can enjoy with their students
  - TripTap: An app for travellers to plan trips to sites of interest, and to find other travellers to go with. Uses the [OpenTripMap API](https://dev.opentripmap.org/product)
  - IdeaBank: An app for brainstorming for app ideas
  - Ask Barbara: An app for foreign students in Italy that helps them navigate the infamously labyrinthian government bureaucracy, and gives other useful local tips.
  - Spatial Cards: A card matching game with single or multi-player modes. Player matching uses [GameKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gamekit).  

I also [published an article](https://medium.com/@shinra.electric/creating-a-product-backlog-for-agile-681698e5564b) titled "Creating a Product Backlog for Agile"

### Year 2: macOS

Normally the Apple Developer Academy is one year in duration. But a few promising students can be accepted into a post-graduate "Pier Program" that is similar to a work experience program. 
I was accepted and assigned as a developer to a project with an external client, and worked on a macOS social networking app using the Agile management processes. 
Over the course of the year we started with the concept, did validation testing and made it to beta release. 
At the end of the year the project was considered "complete" for the Pier Program, and was handed over to the Academy Alumni Board for futher development.

They are mostly zsh/bash scripts.
